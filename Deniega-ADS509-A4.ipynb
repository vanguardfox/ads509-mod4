This is suggests that Republican text key words are far more emphasized relative to the corpus than that of the top words in the Democratic text. This also suggests that the inverse is true in that these words are negative indicators of the opposite party. For example, if the word \"china\" appears in a text, then is both an indicator that it is strongly Republican, but also an indicator that the text is very unlikely Democratic. The key word, \"votes\" would apply in the opposite manner.\n",

Further exploration into the data is needed to identify why there's such a disparity in performance by party affiliation. Initial impressions suggest that Republican tweets may be more politically ambiguous relative to those of their Democratic collegues, which may be a result of party tendencies to use the given medium, Twitter. Further, given the accuracy of Democratic tweets by the Naive Bayes classifier, it may suggest that there's a strong set of feature words that are largely indicative of Democratic party affiliation. Finally, there may be an opportunity to use the key words from the convention data based on most important features to further refine this model."
